# SVELTE: Symbolic Vector Entropy & Latent Tensor Excavation Framework

## Comprehensive Formalization & Architectural Specification

---

## 1. Theoretical Foundations

### 1.1 First Principles & Axiomatization

The SVELTE framework is constructed upon a set of axiomatic assumptions about the structure of neural computation within quantized language models:

**Axiom 1: Latent Symbolic Encoding**
Deep neural networks implicitly encode symbolic computational structures that exist as emergent properties of their distributed weight representations.

**Axiom 2: Structural Invariance Under Transformation**
The fundamental symbolic structures are preserved under certain transformations, including quantization, pruning, and architectural variations, though potentially distorted.

**Axiom 3: Multi-Scale Organizational Hierarchy**
Computational structures exist at multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously, forming a hierarchical grammar of increasingly complex symbolic operations.

**Axiom 4: Topological Continuity of Semantic Space**
The semantic transformations within a model form continuous manifolds with identifiable topological features that correspond to specific computational operations.

**Axiom 5: Entropic Correspondence Principle**
Regions of high information entropy within weight distributions correspond to areas of high semantic complexity or decision boundaries within the model's reasoning process.

### 1.2 Theoretical Framework Extensions

#### 1.2.1 Tensor Field Topology Theory

The weights and activations of a neural network can be conceptualized as tensor fields with specific topological properties. These fields possess critical points, vector flows, and topological invariants that characterize their computational behavior.

#### 1.2.2 Computational Manifold Hypothesis

Transformer computation can be represented as operations on differentiable manifolds where attention mechanisms induce curvature, and the path of information flow follows geodesics on these curved surfaces.

#### 1.2.3 Symbolic Extraction Theorem

Under certain conditions of regularization and structural sparsity, the symbolic structures encoded in neural networks can be algorithmically extracted to a formal grammar with precision proportional to the model's effective dimensionality.

#### 1.2.4 Entropic Boundary Demarcation

The boundaries between distinct computational patterns can be identified through analysis of local entropy gradients, with sharp transitions in entropy corresponding to functional boundaries in the computation graph.

### 1.3 Mathematical Formalism

#### 1.3.1 Tensor Space Representation

Let $M$ represent a quantized language model with $L$ layers, where each layer $l \in L$ contains a set of weight tensors $W_l$ and attention mechanisms $A_l$. The complete tensor space $\mathcal{T}$ is defined as:

$$\mathcal{T} = \{ (W_l, A_l) \mid l \in L \}$$

#### 1.3.2 Symbolic Structure Mapping

A symbolic mapping function $\phi: \mathcal{T} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}$ transforms the tensor space into symbolic space $\mathcal{S}$, where:

$$\phi(T) = \{s_i\}_{i=1}^n$$

And each $s_i$ represents a symbolic computational pattern extracted from tensor regions.

#### 1.3.3 Multi-dimensional Entropy Function

For a tensor subspace $T' \subseteq \mathcal{T}$, the symbolic entropy $H_s$ is defined as:

$$H_s(T') = -\sum_{i=1}^k p(s_i|T') \log p(s_i|T')$$

Where $p(s_i|T')$ represents the probability of symbolic pattern $s_i$ given tensor subspace $T'$.

#### 1.3.4 Attention Curvature Tensor

The curvature of attention mechanisms is represented by a fourth-order tensor $R^{a}_{bcd}$ that captures how attention flows distort the underlying semantic space:

$$R^{a}_{bcd} = \frac{\partial \Gamma^a_{bd}}{\partial x^c} - \frac{\partial \Gamma^a_{bc}}{\partial x^d} + \Gamma^e_{bd}\Gamma^a_{ec} - \Gamma^e_{bc}\Gamma^a_{ed}$$

Where $\Gamma^a_{bc}$ are the Christoffel symbols derived from attention weight gradients.
